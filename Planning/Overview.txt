Development goal/focus:
Documentation, documentation, documentation!
Testing, testing, testing!
Simple and easy to understand usability of the editor as well as the APIs while keeping the flexibility of an advanced GUI builder.
Design and functionality should be oriented towards Visual Studio. The window editor should be as empty as possible to give the user a "canvas"-feeling.
As in WPF, the front- and back-end should be fairly independent of each other. Additionally widgets should be saved and displayed as a custom XML format.
GUIDE should support reverting changes (Ctrl + Z).
