	guide.log

Windows = FileManager:loadFromMultipleFiles("/", ".windows")
FileManager:saveIntoMultipleFiles("/", Windows, ".window")


Log example:

newLog = File:new()
newLog:setPath("/GUIDE/Projects/DoorLock/Log/DoorLock.log")
newLog:save()
-- or --
newLog = File:create("/GUIDE/Projects/DoorLock/Log/DoorLock.log")
	... which one is better? I think the second one as it is simpler and the first one is probably not needed.

LogFile = File:open("/GUIDE/Projects/DoorLock/Log/DoorLock.log")
LogFile:clear()
LogFile:append(see "Logger" for more info)
